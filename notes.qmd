## notes

workshop based on Larsen (2016) -> inequality acceptance driven by 
  - subjective mobility
  - observation of fair treatment
  - observation (?) of middle-class society

Testing step-by-step of three hypotheses

### hypothesis vs research question

RQ: do extracurriculars influence school performance?
HP: When someone takes part in an extracurricolar, then they have higher notes
VARS: Y = Grades (metric), X = extracurricolars participation (Categorical Yes/No)

Methods choice dependes on WHAT I want to explain and with what i do that
strictly speaking LINEAR regression requires a METRIC (continuous) Y
In practice is used also for ordinal categorical variables.
With nominal Y we use Logit/Mlogit

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
